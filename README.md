# Multi-Tier Application Deployment

## Project brief

The scenario is of a DevOps engineer who has been given a multi-tier application stack and has been tasked with deploying the application on a local machine. 

The application deals with a variety of services: web services, database services, application services etc.

The main challenge facing the DevOps engineer, regarding the local setup, is that the local setup is complex and time consuming. To solve this problem, the setup provisioning will be automated with Bash scripts and Virtual Machines will be configured with the use of Infrastructure as Code tools. 

First, the DevOps engineer will manually configure and provision the Virtual Machines, ready for application deployment. This is to ensure that the architecture network is properly configured, with any debugging handled before the automation step.

Finally, the entire setup will be automated.
